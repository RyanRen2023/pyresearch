# Vehicle Management System with Dual Storage and Chart.js Integration

## Overview
This project is a Django-based application that provides CRUD operations for managing vehicle data, supports dual data storage (in-memory and database), and integrates Chart.js for visualizing data through bar and pie charts. The application demonstrates best practices in MVC architecture, AJAX interactivity, and modern web development.
